Resin Identification Code (RIC) was introduced in 1998 to identify the plastics composition making it easier to understand the recyclability and decomposability of plastics. This has been adopted widely and can be found in the bottom of plastic products. The symbols are accompanied by an abbreviated plastic resign types, such as “PET” or “PETE” surrounded by chasing arrows. These symbols are usually molded or embossed at the bottom of containers.

The identification code ranges from 1 to 7, where the lower bound, 1 and 2 can be easily recyclable, while 6 and 7 are difficult to recycle but the 3, 4 and 5 depend upon the composition and availability of recycling facilities.

### **Recyclability based on codes**.

The recyclability of plastics is based on the resin code and its examples are shown below.

1. ***Polyethylene Terephthalate (PETE, PET):*** These are the most common single use plastic bottles such as soft drinks, water, ketchup, condiment bottles, peanut butter, and salad dressing containers. Besides this tote bags, cold drinks cups, thermoformed sheets, carpets, and furniture are also part of it. To recycle these items should be washed and dried before putting them into the recycle bin. The plastic is tuned into flakes and then used to create fiber, furniture, tote bags, bottles, and food containers.

1. ***High Density Polyethylene (HDPE, PE-HD): ***Versatile plastic with many usages such as juice and clear bottles, milk jugs, cleaning products, playground equipment, shampoo bottles, butter, yogurt containers, plastic lumber and trash can liners. These items should be rinsed and dried before recycling. The plastic is recycled into laundry detergent bottles, plastic fencing, floor tiles, picnic tables, lawn chairs and pens.

1. ***Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) or Vinyl (V):*** These are commonly used for pipelining, siding, and fencing. Nonfood bottles such as detergent containers, cooking oil bottles, plastic floors, toys, lawn chairs, bottles for window cleaner and clear wrap for food are some of it examples. These are hard to dispose of as they can break down into dangerous chemicals like vinyl chloride. To dispose of it, local waste management providers need to be contacted to find the correct way to dispose of it. Items such as traffic cones, decks, roadway guts, garden hoses, floor mats, speed bumps and mud flaps can be created out of recycled plastics of this group.

1. ***Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE, PE-LD): ***These are flexible plastics used widely in packaging such as plastic film, plastic bags, tubing, six pack rings, squeeze bottles and bed and frozen food bags. It is considered as a safe plastic for human food usage and not leach chemicals. Not all items are recyclable, local waste management facilities need to be contacted for confirmation. The items are recycled into trash can liners, piping, compost bins, shipping envelopes and composite lumber.

1. ***Polypropylene (PP):*** These are plastics with high melting points, often holding hot liquids. Plates, bowls and cutlery, food containers, catsup bottles, auto parts and industrial fibers are some of its examples. The plastic used here is reusable. One must rinse and dry it before putting it in the recycling bin. Brooms, bicycle racks, battery cables, rakes, ice scrapers and bins are items that can be made from recycled plastics.

1. ***Polystyrene (PS):*** Typical rigid/ foam items such as take out containers, coffee cups and lids, egg cartoons and clamshell containers. These are lightweight items and not easily breakable. It takes a large amount to recycle and is not economical for reprocesses to accept. To prevent the foam from breaking into palettes, place it in a bag and squeeze the air. Plastic insulation, foam packing and take out containers can be made from recycling.

1. ***Other or O:*** All the other forms of plastic include acrylic, nylon, polylactic acid (PLA), polycarbonate and multiple combinations of plastics. Food packaging, safety glasses, bottles, plastic lumber, and headlight lenses are also examples. These plastics are less used and are not recycled, local waste management provider needs to be contacted for more information. To identify this, we must look for chasing arrows with 7 inside and have PLA letters beneath it.

Manufactures and consumers often misinterpret the label as an indication of recyclability or recycled content such as “100% recyclable”, “80% recycled content” or “Please recycle”, leading to confusions. This results in non-recyclable packaging being placed in recyclable bins, which is costly for recycling facilities as they must sort and separate and degrade the quality and value of recycled materials. RIC should be used prominently and must follow specific guidelines, including the use of accompanying numbers and text to clarify the claims.
